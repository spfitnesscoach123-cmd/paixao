<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary goal is to build a Load Manager application for sports coaches and athletes. The immediate objective has shifted from fixing a broken RevenueCat implementation to completely removing it and rebuilding it from scratch.

The user first provided a series of detailed prompts to debug a failing premium subscription system. After multiple failed attempts and extensive debugging that revealed deep architectural and configuration issues, the user made a decisive request to completely rip out all existing subscription and payment logic from the entire application.

Immediately following the removal, the user provided a new, detailed prompt to rewrite the subscription screen with a specific layout, textual content describing the Pro plan features, and two call-to-action (CTA) buttons: Start Free Trial and Cancel Subscription, with specified functionality for each.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Remove All Subscription Logic:** Erase every trace of RevenueCat, StoreKit, premium gates, and payment-related code to create a clean slate.
2.  **Rebuild Subscription UI:** Create a new, clean subscription page that statically displays the Pro plan features, price (R9,99/mês), and cancellation policy.
3.  **Implement CTA Buttons:**
    *   Add a Start Free Trial button that, on click, opens a pop-up explaining the 7-day free trial followed by an automatic charge of 39.99 USD.
    *   Add a Cancel Subscription button.

**User's preferred language**: Português

**what currently exists?**
The application has been completely stripped of its previous (and broken) RevenueCat subscription system. All  components, contexts (), and environment variables related to payments have been removed or neutralized. As a result, all features of the app are currently unlocked and accessible to everyone.

A new, purely presentational subscription page has been created at . It statically displays the features of the Pro Plan, the price, and two non-functional buttons: Start Free Trial and Cancel Subscription.

**Task Detail**:
-   **Task 1**: Implement Subscription Page CTA Functionality
    -   **Where to resume**: The static UI for  is complete. The next step is to implement the logic for the buttons as specified in the user's prompt.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: The subscription page will become interactive, preparing it for the full re-integration of a payment system.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something**: None
    -   **Next Steps**:
        1.  Create a modal/pop-up component.
        2.  In , add an  handler to the Start Free Trial button to trigger the modal.
        3.  The modal must display the text: 7 dias gratuitos e que após esse período será cobrado automaticamente o valor da assinatura 39.99 USD.
        4.  Implement the Cancel Subscription button functionality (this will require re-integrating a subscription provider like RevenueCat).

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    -   (P0) Re-implement the RevenueCat subscription system from scratch. This will involve installing the SDK, creating a new context, and connecting the new UI buttons to the purchase flow.
    -   (P2) Complete the internationalization of the  component and the Avaliações (Assessments) page.
-   **Future Tasks**:
    -   Test the  pipeline's integration with the .
    -   Integrate identity resolution into  and .
    -   Build a UI for manual resolution of ambiguous athlete names.
    -   Build a feature for merging duplicate athlete profiles.

**Completed work in this session**
-   Performed extensive debugging and audits of the previous broken subscription system.
-   Guided the user through correctly configuring their RevenueCat and App Store Connect settings.
-   Diagnosed build failures related to iOS certificates and package dependency issues.
-   Identified a hardcoded price in the backend () which was part of the old, now-removed logic.
-   **Completely removed** all existing subscription and payment logic (RevenueCat SDK, , contexts, etc.) from the entire application.
-   Rebuilt the  page with a new, clean, static UI based on detailed user specifications.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **VBT Rep Counting & Regressions:** The original issues from a previous handoff (rep counting for Deadlift, graph consistency) remain untested and their status is unknown.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **PDF generation in **: This is a major recurring issue that has failed to be fixed multiple times.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   React Native (Expo)
-   React Context API
-   UI Development with static content
-   The goal is to re-introduce RevenueCat for subscriptions.

**key DB schema**
-   The  table in MongoDB is now unused as the backend logic relying on it was part of the removed subscription system.

**changes in tech stack**
-    (RevenueCat) has been effectively removed from the project's logic, though it may remain in .

**All files of reference**
-   : **Critical.** Completely rewritten to be a static UI page. The logic for its CTA buttons is the next task.
-   : Rewritten to be a passthrough component that no longer blocks any features.
-   : Emptied and neutralized.
-   : Modified to remove the .
-   : This file was identified as containing a hardcoded price of . Although the frontend logic that used it was removed, this backend file may still exist and should be noted for the rebuild.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The entire subscription system needs to be rebuilt from scratch, starting with implementing the logic for the buttons on the new  page.

**key api endpoints**
-   All previous subscription-related endpoints (like ) are now obsolete and will need to be re-evaluated during the rebuild.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Responda em Português.**
-   The previous subscription system was **intentionally and completely removed** at the user's request. Your task is to continue rebuilding it from scratch.
-   The UI for the new subscription page () is already built. Your immediate P0 task is to implement the functionality for the CTA buttons on that page, as per the user's last detailed prompt.
    -   Start Free Trial should open a pop-up with specific text.
-   After implementing the button logic, you will need to re-integrate a payment provider (likely RevenueCat) from zero. Plan this carefully.
-   Note the price discrepancy: the user requested R9,99/mês, but the agent implemented 9.99/month. Clarify this with the user before implementing payment logic.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-    was updated to reflect the removal of the old subscription system.
