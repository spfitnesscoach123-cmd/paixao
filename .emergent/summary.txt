<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary goal is to create a fully functional VBT (Velocity-Based Training) Camera feature within a React Native application. This involves several critical requirements:
1.  **Real Pose Detection**: The app must use MediaPipe for real-time pose detection, replacing a previous data simulation. The integration should be via .
2.  **Fix Camera Functionality**: The camera must correctly transition from a Stabilizing Detection state to Tracking and Recording once stable keypoints are detected. The stabilization progress bar must be functional.
3.  **New Feature: Coach Marker**: A new feature must be implemented allowing a coach to tap the screen to manually mark the exact keypoint to be tracked for VBT calculations.
4.  **New Feature: Interactive Tutorial**: A one-time, interactive tutorial must guide the coach on how to use the new Coach Marker feature.
5.  **Data Pipeline Integrity**: The real keypoint data from MediaPipe must flow correctly into the existing VBT calculation pipeline, ensuring all related graphs and reports update in real-time.
6.  **Strict Build Environment**: The application must be built with the New Architecture enabled () and the JSC JavaScript engine (), meaning Hermes must remain **disabled**.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **VBT Camera Correction**: Fix the camera's state management to provide a smooth user experience from stabilization to tracking.
2.  **Manual Tracking Point**: Implement UI for the coach to select a tracking point directly on the camera view.
3.  **Interactive Tutorial**: Implement a one-time tutorial for the VBT camera feature.
4.  **Real-time Data Flow**: Ensure VBT calculations and all associated UI elements are driven by real data from MediaPipe on native platforms.
5.  **Platform Consistency**: Maintain the existing  simulation for the web version while using the real MediaPipe implementation for iOS and Android.
6.  **Environment Stability**: Do not alter the critical build configurations (, ).
7.  **Zero Regressions**: No other part of the application should be affected.

**User's preferred language**: Português

**what currently exists?**
The agent has implemented significant features in the  component.
1.  **VBT Camera Fix**: The logic for state transitions (Stabilizing Detection -> Tracking) has been refactored.
2.  **Coach Marker Feature**: Functionality for a coach to tap the screen, select a keypoint, and see visual feedback has been added. The ability to change the tracked point during a session is also included.
3.  **Interactive Tutorial**: A one-time tutorial overlay was implemented using  to guide users through the new Coach Marker feature.

The web version of the application was smoke-tested to ensure the UI flow to the camera screen is not broken. However, a critical dependency () was imported but **not installed**, which will cause the native build to fail. The core features have not been tested on a native device (iOS/Android). The user's last instruction is a FORCE EXECUTION command to perform a comprehensive audit and test of all new functionality.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent finished implementing all the code for the VBT Camera fixes, the Coach Marker feature, and the new Interactive Tutorial. The final actions involved updating documentation (, ) and performing a UI smoke test on the web version.
-   **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N (Only superficial web UI checks were performed; no native testing was done.)
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: . The user has provided a detailed test plan in their final message (FORCE EXECUTION). The testing agent should be instructed to follow this plan, which includes auditing for location APIs, cleaning caches, and verifying all new features on a native device (iOS/Android).
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1**: Complete the internationalization of the  component. (P1)

-   **Task 1**: Perform a comprehensive audit and end-to-end test of the VBT Camera. (P0 - HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Task Detail**:
-   **Task 1**:
    -   **Where to resume**: The next agent must first fix the broken build by installing the missing dependency. Then, it must invoke the  to execute the user's FORCE EXECUTION test plan.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: A fully tested and validated VBT Camera feature that works on native devices, confirmation that the app is free of location-related APIs, and a final report confirming the app is ready for submission to TestFlight.
    -   **Status**: BLOCKED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend (requires native device testing).
    -   **Blocked on something**: **Issue 1: Missing Dependency Installation**.

        3.  The next agent MUST run this command in  before attempting to build or test the application.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?**: The native build will fail without this dependency. Installing it will allow the application to compile and run on a native device, unblocking all further testing.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend.
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Incomplete feature implementation (localization).
-   **Recurrence count**: 10
-   **Status**: NOT STARTED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Native Pose Detection**: Using  with .
-   **On-Screen User Interaction**: Capturing touch events () on an overlay and mapping screen coordinates to select a pose detection keypoint.
-   **Interactive Tutorial**: Using  to manage a one-time flag () to control the tutorial's visibility.
-   **Complex State Management**: Juggling multiple states within a single component for UI phase (config, selection, tracking), tutorial steps, and real-time data from the camera.
-   **UI Overlays**: Using absolutely positioned  components to display tutorial text, animations, and user feedback on top of the live camera feed.

**key DB schema**
-   No database schema changes were made.

**changes in tech stack**
-   **Added (conceptually)**: . **The package needs to be installed.**

**All files of reference**
-    (Primary file with all new code)
-    (Updated build number)
-    (Updated with new features)
-    (Created)

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  component is now extremely large (over 1000 lines) and complex. It manages application logic, UI state, tutorial flows, and native callbacks. It should be broken down into smaller, more manageable child components (e.g., , , ).

**key api endpoints**
-   No API endpoints were changed.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Your first action is to fix the broken build.** The previous agent forgot to install a dependency. Run yarn add v1.22.22

8.  **Agent**: Incorrectly concluded the task was complete and prepared to finish. (INCORRECT - NATIVE TESTING WAS SKIPPED)
9.  **User**: Interrupted with a description of the desired tutorial. (This seems to be a context glitch, the agent already had the spec).
10. **User**: Provided a FORCE EXECUTION command, demanding a complete audit and end-to-end test of all implemented features, explicitly checking for location API remnants and validating functionality on a real device. (PENDING - THIS IS THE CURRENT TASK).

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: The native build is broken due to a missing dependency (). The core features implemented in this session are completely untested on their target native platforms.
-   **Mocked**: Pose detection for the web platform remains mocked, which is the intended behavior.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   
-   
-   
-   
-    (Imported but **NOT INSTALLED**)

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
-   **Test files created**: []
-   **Known regressions**: None known, but the new features are untested.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Coach**:  / 

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   **CRITICAL**: The agent forgot to install the  package after adding the import statement, which will break the native build.
-   The agent failed to perform any testing on a native device (iOS/Android) for the features that were built specifically for that environment (real pose detection, coach marker, tutorial).
-   The agent did not follow the standard workflow of Test -> Verify -> Finish. It attempted to finish after only coding and performing a superficial web UI check.</analysis>
