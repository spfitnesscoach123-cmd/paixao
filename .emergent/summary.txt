<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary goal is to create a fully functional VBT (Velocity-Based Training) Camera feature within a React Native application and prepare it for a TestFlight release. This involves several critical requirements:
1.  **VBT Camera Feature**: Fix camera state transitions, implement a Coach Marker for manual keypoint selection, and add a one-time interactive tutorial for this feature.
2.  **Real Pose Detection**: Use MediaPipe for real-time pose detection on native platforms (iOS/Android), ensuring data flows correctly into the VBT calculation pipeline.
3.  **Build Integrity and Audit**: Ensure the application is completely free of location-related APIs to avoid Apple's  warning upon submission. This includes removing , ensuring  is absent, and setting  for .
4.  **Fix Build/Deployment Errors**: Resolve issues preventing a successful build and deployment via EAS (Expo Application Services).
5.  **Strict Build Environment**: The application must be built with the New Architecture enabled () and the JSC JavaScript engine ().

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  A fully functional and tested VBT camera with Coach Marker and Tutorial features.
2.  A clean build that passes Apple's review without location-related warnings.
3.  A successful iOS build ( file) generated via EAS, ready for TestFlight.
4.  Maintain existing build configurations (, ).
5.  Zero regressions to other application features.

**User's preferred language**: Português

**what currently exists?**
The agent has performed all possible pre-build steps for an EAS (Expo Application Services) iOS build. The codebase is clean, dependencies are installed, and all code-level fixes from the previous session are intact. The agent successfully used the user-provided  to initialize a new EAS project (, ID: ) and fixed a configuration error in . The project is fully prepared for the final build step, but this step is blocked.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was repeatedly attempting to execute the An Expo user account is required to proceed.

-   **Agent Testing Done**: N/A
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: NA. The task is a build, not a feature test.

**Issues Detail**:
-   All listed issues are pending from previous sessions and have not been started.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1**: Generate the final iOS build for TestFlight. (P0 - HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Task Detail**:
-   **Task 1**:
    -   **Where to resume**: The agent cannot resume this task. The user must execute the build command in their local macOS environment to complete the one-time interactive setup of Apple Developer credentials.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: Generation of a  file for TestFlight, fulfilling the user's primary objective.
    -   **Status**: BLOCKED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend (requires user testing on TestFlight).
    -   **Blocked on something**: The An Expo user account is required to proceed.

Log in to EAS with email or username (exit and run eas login --help to see other login options)
Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username process for a new project requires interactive input (Apple ID login) to generate and configure iOS distribution credentials (certificates and provisioning profiles). The agent's non-interactive environment cannot provide this input.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    -   Complete internationalization of  and the Avaliações page. (P1)
    -   Test the  pipeline's integration with the . (P2)
    -   Fix back button icon rendering on web. (P3)
-   **Future Tasks**:
    -   Integrate identity resolution into  and .
    -   Build a UI for manual resolution of ambiguous athlete names.
    -   Implement a feature for merging duplicate athlete profiles.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **EAS Project Initialization (DONE)**: Successfully linked the local project to the user's Expo account by running An Expo user account is required to proceed.

-   **Build Configuration Fix (DONE)**: Resolved an EAS build error by adding  to .
-   **Build Failure Diagnosis (DONE)**: Systematically diagnosed multiple build failures, including the need for an , project initialization, and the final critical blocker related to missing iOS credentials.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: EAS Project Slug Conflict**
    -   **Debug checklist**: The previous session identified a slug conflict with . In this session, the agent created a new project, , as a workaround. However, the original conflict may still affect automated deployments from the Emergent platform if they are hardcoded to use the old slug.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?**: Resolving this would align the platform's automated deployment system with the user's existing EAS project structure, preventing future deployment failures.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: N/A (Infrastructure issue).
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Incomplete feature implementation (localization).
-   **Recurrence count**: 11
-   **Status**: NOT STARTED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **EAS (Expo Application Services)**: The build pipeline for the React Native app. The agent has dealt with authentication (), project initialization (An Expo user account is required to proceed.

Log in to EAS with email or username (exit and run eas login --help to see other login options)
Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username), and diagnosing credential management failures.
-   **iOS Code Signing**: The core reason for the build blockage. EAS requires Apple-issued certificates and provisioning profiles to sign an  file. The initial creation of these credentials is an interactive process.

**key DB schema**
-   No database schema changes were made.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-    (Main feature file)
-    (Configuration file for Expo/EAS)
-    (EAS build profile configuration, modified in this session)
-   
-   

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  component remains very large and could be broken down into smaller, more manageable child components.

**key api endpoints**
-   No API endpoints were changed.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **The primary task is CRITICALLY BLOCKED by an environmental limitation.** You **MUST NOT** attempt to run An Expo user account is required to proceed.

Log in to EAS with email or username (exit and run eas login --help to see other login options)
Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username again. It will fail.
-   The root cause is that the user's Expo account lacks the necessary Apple Developer credentials (Distribution Certificate, Provisioning Profile) for this project.
-   This setup **MUST** be performed by the user in an **interactive terminal on a macOS machine**. This is a one-time requirement for a new project.
-   Your first action should be to clearly and firmly inform the user that they must execute the following command on their own Mac to proceed:
    Resolved "production" environment for the build. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/eas/environment-variables/#setting-the-environment-for-your-builds
No environment variables with visibility "Plain text" and "Sensitive" found for the "production" environment on EAS.

Specified value for "ios.bundleIdentifier" in app.json is ignored because an ios directory was detected in the project.
EAS Build will use the value found in the native code.


✔ Using remote iOS credentials (Expo server)

If you provide your Apple account credentials we will be able to generate all necessary build credentials and fully validate them.
This is optional, but without Apple account access you will need to provide all the missing values manually and we can only run minimal validation on them.
Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Do you want to log in to your Apple account?
-   Explain that during this process, EAS will prompt them to log into their Apple Developer account to automatically generate and store the required credentials. Once this is done, future builds may be able to run non-interactively. Do not proceed until the user acknowledges this.
