<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user has issued a directive to ignore all previous tasks and start a new project from scratch.

The new project is to build a hardware-agnostic, CSV-based import system for jump data collected from sports contact mats. The system must be built with a clean architecture, separating concerns for parsing, validation, and calculation.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (as per user's latest request):**
1.  **Core Module ()**: Create a full-stack module to handle CSV data import for jumps.
    *   : Define a canonical  data model using Pydantic.
    *   : Implement safe and tolerant CSV parsing.
    *   : Validate data against the schema and specific business rules (e.g.,  is mandatory for 'DJ' but must be null for 'CMJ').
    *   : Calculate derived metrics.
    *   : Create a directory for provider-specific data mappers (e.g., , ).
2.  **Canonical Data Model ()**: All imported data must be normalized to a standard Pydantic model including fields like , , , , , , , and .
3.  **Business & Calculation Rules**:
    *   Empty CSV fields must be parsed as .
    *   If  is missing, calculate it from  using the formula: .
    *   Calculate Reactive Strength Index (RSI) as  only when both values are present.
4.  **Athlete Integration**:
    *   The  must reference an existing athlete in the system.
    *   The system must never create athletes automatically during import. An error should be returned if the athlete does not exist.
5.  **API Endpoints (FastAPI)**:
    *   : Reads and validates a CSV, returning a report of valid/invalid rows with detailed errors, without saving to the database.
    *   : Persists pre-validated jump records to a dedicated  collection in the database.
6.  **Analytical Module ()**:
    *   Create a new module for sports science analytics (, , , etc.).
    *   Implement an endpoint  that returns a structured JSON report with readiness status, trends, and a fatigue flag.
7.  **Testing**: Create automated tests covering parsing, validation, calculations, and API endpoints.

**what currently exists?**
The agent has successfully implemented the entire  module as requested. This includes the complete directory structure (, , , , and mappers), the Pydantic models, and the two required API endpoints ( and ). The system correctly parses, validates, calculates derived metrics, and imports jump data from CSV files. Unit tests and sample CSVs were also created, and the entire flow was successfully tested via API calls. The agent has also created the directory and empty file structure for the next major task: the  module.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The agent had just started work on the new  module, which is the next major feature requested by the user. The last actions were creating the directory  and the initial empty Python files within it (, , , , , and ).
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done**: N
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: backend testing agent
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no known bugs or issues. The pending work is the implementation of the next feature.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1**: Implement the  module and the reporting endpoint (Priority: P0)
    -   **Where to resume**: The file structure is ready in . The next step is to implement the business logic inside each file, starting with  to calculate athlete baselines.
    -   **What will be achieved**: An analytical engine that provides sports science insights (readiness, fatigue, trends) from the imported jump data, accessible via a new API endpoint.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: backend
    -   **Blocked on something**: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    -   **P0**: Complete the implementation of the  module logic (trends, fatigue, etc.).
    -   **P1**: Implement and test the new  endpoint in  to expose the analysis results.
-   **Future Tasks**:
    -   **P2**: Implement statistical normalization (Z-scores, percentile of best) for cross-device and cross-athlete comparisons.
    -   **P3**: Build a minimal frontend UI for CSV upload, data visualization (session table, charts), and displaying readiness status.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Jump Data Import System (DONE)**:
    - Created the  module with a clean architecture (, , , , ).
    - Implemented API endpoints  and  in .
    - Implemented business logic for data validation and derived metric calculations (jump height from flight time, RSI).
    - Added unit tests in  and successfully passed all 30 tests.
- **Bug Fix (DONE)**:
    - Resolved an issue where  was not being correctly mapped due to incorrect manufacturer detection. Added  to the  to fix the underlying issue.
- **Documentation (DONE)**:
    - Updated  with details of the new jump import system.
- **Module Scaffolding (DONE)**:
    - Created the complete file structure for the next major task, the  module.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All identified issues were resolved during the session.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None. The user started an entirely new project, making the previous fork's context irrelevant.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend**: FastAPI
-   **Data Modeling**: Pydantic for strict data validation, serialization, and settings management.
-   **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns within the  module (Parsing, Validation, Calculation, Mapping).
-   **Data Processing**: A pipeline that takes raw CSV data, identifies the provider, maps columns to a canonical model, validates business rules, calculates derived metrics, and prepares it for storage.
-   **Database**: MongoDB, with a dedicated  collection.

**key DB schema**
-   **jump_data** collection (documents based on ):
    -   :  (references an athlete in the  collection)
    -   :  (Enum: SJ, CMJ, DJ, RJ)
    -   : 
    -   : 
    -   : 
    -   : 
    -   : 
    -   :  (e.g., 'generic', 'chronojump')
    -   :  (The original, unmodified CSV row for auditing)
    -   ... (other optional metrics like , , etc.)

**changes in tech stack**
No changes to the core stack. Pydantic was heavily utilized for the new feature implementation as per user requirements.

**All files of reference**
-   **Created & Implemented**:
    -    (and all files within)
    -   
    -   
-   **Created (Skeleton only)**:
    -    (and all files within)
-   **Modified**:
    -   : Added the  endpoints.
    -   : Updated with documentation for the new feature.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
None. The code is new and follows the clean architecture specified by the user.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Validates a jump data CSV and returns a summary.
-   : Imports validated jump data into the database.
-   : (Implicitly available) Lists available data mappers.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Project Pivot**: You MUST ignore the initial handoff summary regarding GPS data. The project has been completely restarted to focus on **jump data analysis**. The user's instructions starting from message #5 are the new source of truth.
-   **Current State**: The data *ingestion* part ( module) is complete, tested, and working. Do not modify it unless a bug is found.
-   **Next Task**: Your immediate priority is to implement the logic for the **** module, following the user's detailed plan in message #131. This involves calculating baselines, trends, and fatigue flags.
-   **Language**: All communication with the user MUST be in **Português**.
