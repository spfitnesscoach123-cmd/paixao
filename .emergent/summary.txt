<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to complete the project by implementing Phase 3 of the VBT via Camera feature, which involved integrating camera-based (simulated) data into the app's existing graphs and PDF reports.

After completing this, the user made two subsequent requests:
1.  Update the application's logo across all relevant screens and generate the necessary image assets for an App Store submission.
2.  Fix a critical bug where the VBT via Camera button causes the application to crash on iOS devices when distributed via TestFlight. The user specified that this is likely due to a missing  permission in the app's configuration and provided the exact string to use.

**User's preferred language**: Português

**what currently exists?**
The VBT via Camera feature is fully integrated with graphs and PDF reports. The app logo is updated, and iOS assets are generated. The critical iOS camera crash has been addressed by updating  to include the required  plugin and the correct  permission string. The fix is now awaiting verification from the user, who needs to create a new native build and test it on TestFlight.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Fixing a critical bug where the VBT via Camera button crashes the app on iOS TestFlight. The agent correctly identified that in addition to the incorrect permission string, the  plugin was missing from the  array in . The agent applied both fixes.
-   **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: NA. The change requires a new native build (An Expo user account is required to proceed.

-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1**: VBT via Camera button crashes on TestFlight (iOS). (P0) - *Fix has been implemented, verification is pending by the user.*
-   **Issue 2**: Complete the internationalization of the  component. (P1)

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1: VBT via Camera button crashes on TestFlight (iOS).**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent updated  to:
        1.  Replace the existing  string with the user-provided one: .
        2.  Add  to the  array, which was missing and is required for permissions to be correctly linked in a native build.
    -   **Next debug checklist**: Await user confirmation. If the crash persists, the next step would be to investigate  conflicts or other plugin issues, though the current fix is highly likely to have resolved the problem.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Expo Plugins ()**: Understood that for native permissions (like camera) to work in an Expo Managed project with EAS Build, the corresponding package (e.g., ) must be listed in the  array of . This links the native code during the prebuild phase.
-   **iOS Info.plist Permissions**: Identified that  is a required key in the  object within  to prompt the user for camera access on iOS.

**key DB schema**
-   No changes were made to the database schema.

**changes in tech stack**
-   No changes were made to the tech stack.

**All files of reference**
-    (The single file modified in this session to fix the iOS crash).
-    (Updated with completed work).

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   None.

**key api endpoints**
-   No new endpoints were created.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The immediate priority is to **wait for user feedback**. The fix for the iOS camera crash has been implemented, but it cannot be tested in this environment.
-   You must inform the user that they need to create a new build (An Expo user account is required to proceed.

Log in to EAS with email or username (exit and run eas login --help to see other login options)
Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username) and deploy it to TestFlight to verify if the crash is resolved.
-   **Do not proceed** with any other tasks (like internationalization) until the user confirms the fix is working or provides new information if the issue persists.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-    (updated)

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
-   **User (Latest)**: Reported the app crashes on TestFlight when VBT via Camera is tapped. Provided strict instructions and the exact permission string () needed to fix it in . (ADDRESSED - PENDING VERIFICATION)

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: The VBT Camera feature on iOS is in a fix implemented, pending verification state. It was previously broken.
-   **Mocked**: The core VBT camera tracking logic remains a physics-based simulation.

-   
-   **Planned**: , 

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: NO (Not applicable for this type of native configuration change).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
-   **Test files created**: None.
-   **Known regressions**: None from this session. The fix addressed a known regression.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Coach**:  / 

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   Nothing. The agent correctly followed the user's explicit and strict instructions, focusing solely on the requested bug fix and avoiding any other changes.</analysis>
